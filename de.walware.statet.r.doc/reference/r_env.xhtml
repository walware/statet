<h1>R Environments</h1>

<p>
An R environment is a given version of R and a collection of R libraries.  
R environments are used to launch R correctly and to identify a clear working environment for R
related tasks.  For example a help index is associated with an R environment.</p>
<p>
There are several configuration types of R environments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>User-defined <b>Local</b>: For common R installations on the local system.<br/>
		This is the default type and the usual choice for most users.</li>
	<li>User-defined <b>Remote</b>: For R installations on a remote system.<br/>
		This type can be used for remote console.</li>
	<li><b>Embedded</b>: For R installations provided by an Eclipse plug-in.<br/>
		This type cannot be created and edited by the user.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preferences</h3>
<p>
The R environments for your Eclipse workspace can be viewed and configured in the preferences:
<span class="uisequence indent">StatET &gt; Run/Debug &gt; R Environments</span></p>

<p>
One can specify as many R environments as wanted as long as they have a unique name.  Buttons 
'Add..', 'Edit', etc. allow to define new environments or edit existing ones.  Using the 'Default'
button is possible to define a environment as default environment for the Eclipse workspace.</p>

<h4>User-defined Local Configurations</h4>
<p>
For user-defined local configurations, the user will be asked to provide a name and to indicate the 
path to the R home directory for that given R.  R home, also known as the environment variable 
<code>R_HOME</code>, is the root directory of the R installation, containing among others the 
sub-directories <code>bin</code>, <code>etc</code> and <code>library</code>.  Some R installations 
supports different sub-architectures (e.g. 32-bit <code>i386</code> and 64-bit <code>x86_64</code>); 
you can change it in the drop down field 'Architecture'.  
If these settings are correct, the button 'Detect Default Properties/Settings' allows to load the 
defaults for the other properties and settings.  Experienced user can also edit and adapt them 
manually, for instance to add additional R library locations.</p>

<h4>User-defined Remote Configurations</h4>
<p>
The R home directory, installation locations and R libraries for remote R environments are defined
by the server running on the remote system. Therefore most options of the local R environments 
configurations are not available for remote environments.</p>
