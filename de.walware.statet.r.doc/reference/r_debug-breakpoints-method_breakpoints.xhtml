<h1 class="Head">R Method Breakpoints</h1>

<p>First, the name 'method' is originate from Eclipse and means in the context of R all functions,
not only methods like S4 methods.  Method breakpoints are always associated with a functions and 
allows to suspend the execution thread at the entry and exit of it.  Each positions can be enabled 
and disabled separately, its settings are indicated in the icons by and right arrow at the top 
(<img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint-method_entry.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/>) 
for the function entry and an left arrow at the bottom (<img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint-method_entry.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/>)
for the function exit.</p>

<h4>Adding Method Breakpoints</h4>

<p>To create a new method breakpoint, open the file in a the source editor and:</p>
<ul>
	<li>By using the <span class="uilabel">Toggle Method Breakpoint</span> command:<ol>
		<li>Set the cursor inside at any position inside the definition of the function the 
			breakpoint should be associated to.</li>
		<li>Trigger the command <span class="uisequence">Toggle Method Breakpoint</span>.</li>
		</ol>
		This way ensures that a method breakpoint and not another type is created.
	</li>
	<li>Use the action <span class="uisequence">Toggle Breakpoint</span> in the context menu
		of the editor ruler in a line of the function header.  
		You can also double-click on the editor ruler to execute this command.</li>
	<li>By using the common <span class="uilabel">Toggle Breakpoint</span> command:<ol>
		<li>Set the cursor inside the header of the function the breakpoint should be 
			associated to.</li>
		<li>Trigger the common command <span class="uisequence">Toggle Breakpoint</span>.</li>
		</ol>
		The keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> is associated by default to this command.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Removing Method Breakpoints</h4>

<p>Since the ways to create a method breakpoint described above are toggle operation, you can 
also use them again to remove the method breakpoint.  Beside that, the Breakpoint view offers
additional actions to remove the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-remove_viewaction.htm"
>selected</a> or <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-removeall_viewaction.htm"
>all</a> breakpoints.</p>

<h4>Changing the Settings for the Entry / Exit Property</h4>

<p>The entry and exit position for a method breakpoint can be enabled and disabled in the 
	Breakpoint view.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the breakpoint to change.<br/>
		The Breakpoint view shows properties supported by the selected breakpoint in the 
		detail pane below or beside the breakpoints list.</li>
	<li>Use the checkboxes <span class="uisequence">Entry</span> and <span class="uisequence">Exit</span> 
		to enable or disable the positions.</li>
</ol>
