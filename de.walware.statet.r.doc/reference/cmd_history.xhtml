<h1>Cmd History View</h1>

<p>The Cmd History View records and displays all R commands that were used
during a session. Double clicking on an item from the command history will
submit the given line to the R Console again. The copy action copies
the text of the selected commands to clipboard.</p>

<h2>Cmd History Actions</h2>
<p>The Cmd History toolbar and menu provide the following special actions:</p>

<h4>Search bar</h4>
<p>The Cmd History search bar (the text field in the toolbar) allows to search
for a given command in the command history. On pressing Enter, the first matching
result will be highlighted. The arrows right to the search bar allow to navigate
to the following and previous search result. You can use the common wildcards 
* = any string and ? = any char like in other dialogs in Eclipse.
Hovering over an item in the command history will highlight the command as well
as the exact date and time at which the command was submitted to the R Console.</p>

<h4>Scroll-Lock button&nbsp;<img alt="Scroll lock button" src="../icons/loctool/scrolllock.gif"/></h4>
<p>The scroll-lock button is a toggle that allows to fix the user's view on
the Cmd History at a given location. The lock on scrolling, however, does
not prevent the user to manually scroll through the command history.</p>

<h4>Load and Save History</h4>
<p>R has a mechanism to save and load a command history to a file which is by
default named <code>.Rhistory</code>. The options Load History and Save History
provide a convenient interface to perform these actions using the Eclipse file
browser.</p>

<h4>Filter Empty Commands</h4>
<p>A command history can contain comment blocks as well as blank lines. In
order to hide these lines from the Cmd History view, one can check the
Filter Empty Commands option in the menu.</p>
