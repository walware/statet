<h1>R Environment Index</h1>

<p>The index is required for the R help integrated in StatET.</p>

<h2>Indexing of R Environments</h2>

<p>An R environment is indexed within the R console in StatET.  The R environment used to start
the R console is also used for all other operations, which are associated with R environments, 
including the indexing operations.  Therefore, to index an environment, the user has to start
an R console (local or remote) for this R environment.</p>

<h3>Preferences / Automatic Modes</h3>

<p>The preference page of the R environments at
<span class="uisequence indent">StatET &gt; Run/Debug &gt; R Environments</span>
offers in the lower part an option to configure globally the automatic indexing of R environments.</p>

<img alt="Screenshot R Environments preference page" src="../images/screenshot_r_environments.png"/>

<p>The user can select between three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Check and Update Automatically</b>: StatET automatically checks if new packages are installed or 
indexed packages are updated (based on the version number).  When it detects changes, the index for 
the concerned packages is updated.  The user is notified about the start and the success of the 
update.</li>
<li><b>Check Automatically and Ask</b>: Like the previous mode, but if changes are detected, StatET 
asks the user before it starts the update, if the indexing operations should be performed or if 
the user wants to postpone the update.</li>
<li><b>Manual</b>: StatET does never check if the index is created or up-to-date.  The user must 
use the commands below to manage the R environment indexes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manual Operations / Commands</h3>

<p>It is possible to manually update the R environment index of the current R console on demand.</p>

<table class="style1">
<thead><tr>
	<th></th>
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<th>Availability</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr><th colspan="4">
		<p>The commands are accessible in the submenu <span class="uisequence">R environment</span> 
		in the menu of the Console view.</p></th></tr>
<tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>Index completely</td>
	<td><p>This action discards the current R environment index if available, and newly indexes 
	it completely.</p></td>
	<td>View Menu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>Index changes</td>
	<td><p>If the user triggers this action, StatET indexes only the changes of the R environment,
	like in the automatic mode described above.</p></td>
	<td>View Menu</td>
</tr>
