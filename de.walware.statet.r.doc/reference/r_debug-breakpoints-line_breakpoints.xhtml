<h1 class="Head">R Line Breakpoints</h1>

<p>Line breakpoints are the most usual breakpoints set to a line a R source file.  Beside the 
common case of breakpoints inside a function definition (<img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/>), 
line breakpoints can be also set outside of function definition to toplevel commands in the R script.  
These <b>toplevel breakpoints</b> are indicated in the icon by an overlaid prompt symbol 
(<img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint-toplevel.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/>).
Toplevel breakpoints are never <a href="r_debug-breakpoints-add_remove.xhtml#installed">installed</a>,
they are directly handled when submitting code in StatET.</p>

<h4>Adding Line Breakpoints</h4>

<p>To create a new line breakpoint, open the file in a the source editor and:</p>
<ul>
	<li>By using the <span class="uilabel">Toggle Line Breakpoint</span> command:<ol>
		<li>Set the cursor inside at any position inside the definition of the function the 
			breakpoint should be associated to.</li>
		<li>Trigger the command <span class="uisequence">Toggle Method Breakpoint</span>.</li>
		</ol>
		This way ensures that a line breakpoint and not another type is created.
	</li>
	<li>Use the action <span class="uisequence">Toggle Breakpoint</span> in the context menu
		of the editor ruler in the line you want to set the breakpoint.  
		You can also double-click on the editor ruler to execute this command.
		<p>Note that this way creates in special contexts other breakpoints than a line breakpoint,
			for example in line with function header a method breakpoint.</p>
	</li>
	<li>By using the common <span class="uilabel">Toggle Breakpoint</span> command:<ol>
		<li>Set the cursor inside the header of the function the breakpoint should be 
			associated to.</li>
		<li>Trigger the common command <span class="uisequence">Toggle Breakpoint</span>.</li>
		</ol>
		The keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> is associated by default to this command.
		<p>Note that this way creates in special contexts other breakpoints than a line breakpoint,
			for example in line with function header a method breakpoint.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Removing Line Breakpoints</h4>

<p>Since the ways to create a line breakpoint described above are toggle operation, you can 
also use them again to remove the line breakpoint.  Beside that, the Breakpoint view offers
additional actions to remove the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-remove_viewaction.htm"
>selected</a> or <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-removeall_viewaction.htm"
>all</a> breakpoints.</p>
